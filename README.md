# Investment and Bond Calculator

This Python script allows you to calculate the interest on an investment or the monthly repayment on a home loan (bond).

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Run the script by executing the following command in your terminal:

   ```shell
   python finance_calculators.py
The script will prompt you to enter either "investment" or "bond" to proceed.

If you enter "investment", you will be asked to provide the deposit amount, interest rate, investment period in years, and choose between simple or compound interest. The script will then calculate the amount you will have at the end of the investment period.

If you enter "bond", you will be asked to provide the present value of the house, interest rate, and the number of months for repayment. The script will then calculate the monthly repayment amount.

The script will display the calculated result based on your input.

If you enter an invalid input or option, the script will display an error message.
